## Search and Filtering Panel

Searching and filtering allows you to quickly focus on the records you want to see. Bellow we describe the various searching and filtering options available to you.

- Search and Filtering section is automatically available on each entity List View.
- Searching works on the current entity records.
- Filtering works also on related records, which are configured by the Administrator.
- For search or filtering to be performed enter your search sting, set the filter you wish and click on the magnifier icon.
- Use the Global Search if you wish to search globally across all the entities.
- Per default search fill find all the records, which attributes start with the search string.
- If you want to search for the records, which attributes contains the search sting, please use symbol "%" before your search string (without space), using of the "%" at the end of the search sting is not necessary.
- The fields available for searching can be configured by Developers in the metadata of the appropriate entity.
- You can have one or more filter based on a certain field for all field types besides of 
  - Boolean
  - Array
  - Multi-Enum
  - Enum
  - Related entities
- A field of any of this types can be used as filter only once, because there is no need for it.
- The system defers between following operators: OR and AND.
  - Currently using of operators in the search field is not possible.
  - Operator AND is automatically applied between filters set up for different fields, eg "name" and "brand"
  - Operator OR is automatically applied between filters set up for the same field, eg both filter set up for "name"
  - Operator NOR is directly not available, but can be set by setting specific filter criteria for almost each field type.
- To reset all the filter set up completely ckick on the Reset Button, to the right of the search field.

### Automatic search mask recognition (in developing)

- TreoPIM has automatic search mask recognition.
- This can be considered as Quick Search Function.
- While you start typing TreoPIM determines automatically the search mask type of your search string -- available are Text, Number, Date and 
- Depending on this type the system searches through all entity fields with appropriate field type.
- Pop-up with auto-suggestions appears with the information about field name and amount of search result for this field, i.e. "Address: 3 results", and the text link to show the results.
- If nothing is chosen from the auto-suggest pop-up click on the magnifier icon to normal search to be performed (only through the fields listed in the metadata for this entity).
- After Clicking on the search results the appropriate filter will be set automatically search field will be left empty.
